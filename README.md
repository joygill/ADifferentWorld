# adifferentworld

This is the exhibition site I created for A Different World an exhibiton that ran from October 24th to Dec 1st at the Bronx Artspace. 

I really wanted to preview the work of each artist in the show. So when you hover over their name it reveals a piece of work from them. 
Was my first time making a truly mobile-first site as well as my 1st site with some Jquery funcitonality. No templates.
